NOTE, program will create a folder called "output-plotCLK30s" in the CURRENT
directory (directory from which code is run).
This contains the gnuplot files. If you don't need them, they can be deleted.
If it can't create the new directory (i.e. if you use windows), it will just
place the gnuplot files in the current directory.

1:
The directory that contains the 30_s clk files, AND the PRN_GPS file

3:
Which day to run the code for 0=sun, 6=mon.
Put '7' to run for each day.
Will output a sepperate file for each day.

5: Which epoch range to plot?
If you put "0 0" will plot the entire day.

6:
The minimum R^2 value that will be allowed in the plot.
i.e., clocks that have a worse fit than this will be skipped.
If MinR^2>0, but you don't remove a poly, nothing will be plotted [since R^2=0]

7:
Removes a polynomial, three inputs: a b c.
a: 0= do nothing, 1=removes a polynomial.
b: order for the polynomial. Can be any integer (but not 0). 2 is default.
c: Weighted? If =1, uses the formal errors to perform weighted least squares.

8:
Difference the data.
Note: "0" doesn't do nothing.
-1 = Do nothing
0  = Don't difference, but "center" the data by subtracting the average
1  = single-order difference z_i = d_i+1 - d_i
2  = double difference  z_i = d_i+2 - 2d_i+1 + d_i
(note, I do not devide by 30s, since the numbers become too small).

9:
Plot parameters. Three inputs, a b c.
a: 0= use gnuplot to plot to screen. 1=use LaTeX to plot to pdf
b: 0= plot with points+error bars. 1= plot with lines. 2=points, no error bars.
c: Offset. Each subsequent clock will be offset by this amount (so they won't
   all be laid on top of each other).

10:
Which specific clocks to plot.
Either write "all" or Some combination of Clock/Block.
For example:
'all'   = will plot all clocks
'G15'   = Will only plot the clock with PRN=15
'Cs'    = will plot all Cs clocks
'CsIIF' = Will plot all Cs clocks that are IIF block satellites
'IIA'   = Will plot all clocks (both Rb and Cs) that are IIA block
