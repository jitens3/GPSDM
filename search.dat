====================/

1. XXX Path for these may vary XXX
Location of data files

2. XXX Path for these may vary XXX
Location of PSD and ACF files.
  PSD files are used to simulate realistic clock data.
  ACF files are used to generate the covariance/Hessian matrices (multivariate)
  Neither files are needed if you use only white noise.


3.  XXX Path for these may vary XXX
Location for numerical prior CDF files.
  These must be plain text files, named:
    "psi.cdf"       - For angles: note: psi angle (in DM halo frame!)
    "psiperp.cdf"   - For angles (perpendicular)
    "v.cdf"         - For (scalar) velocity
    "vperp.cdf"     - For perpendicular (scalar) velocity

4. Sanity checks and binary files:
  a) Inclusion of the sanity check print (will happen every day if specified 1)
  b) Inclusion of the binary files (1 for include)

5. Week/day range:
Refers to the start week & day + end week & day as
  the week in its actual value (ie- w 1200) and day
  as its relative value to the week (ie- d {0-6})

6. ACF file 'path':
The label that was applied to the PSD/ACF files. Usually refers to the
    weeks that were used to create them. E.g., the PSD file:
    CsII-15-AMC2-128-19.psd  The label is "128-19".

7.exact vs. approx.:
 
  b) Use cholesky inversion (1) or approximate inversion (0)
*"mixed" difference: 2-order for CsII and CsIIA, 1-order for all others.

8. Detrend & Difference:
  a) Difference. 0 = 'zeroing' the data, 1 = taking 1st order difference.
  b) Subtracting polynomials from data. 0 = it doesn't, 1 = it does

9. Model designation:
Three inputs:
  a) model: twall, dwall, monopole, string
  b) Rdm: overall impact parameter, in units of Rgps. Typical ~0.7. No range.
  c) alpha: impact parameter angle, in units of pi. [0,2]. No range.
b and c only needed for monopoles/strings

10. Coupling:
Assume one particular coupling (i.e. to alpha, m_e, or m_q) dominates.
    Used to work out the relative sensitivity coefficients for each clock.
    can be: alpha, me, mq, or 'all'
    'all' (or anything else) will assume all clocks respond the same way.

11. Monte Carlo integration, hmin value:
N_MC. Number of grid points to use for MC grid.
hmin is integration bounds for the h-integral.

12. Odds & SNR cutoffs:
  a)  O_cut. Odds ratios above this value (with j=+/-1) are considered "found"
  b)  SNR_cut. SNR values above this within 1 epoch of injected signal are "found"

13.Cores & ISE:
  (a) Limit the number of cores the code is parallelised over.
      Does nothing if openMP is not enabled.
      If you place 0, there will be no limit (default).
      If you place 1, there will be no parallelisation.
      Placing a larger number than the number of cores can actually be better too
      (depending on the type of CPU?)
  (b) Parallelise over iterations (=1), or inside the MC loop (=0).
      Set to 1 for fastest results.

14. Estimate parameter
If an SNR value exceeds the threshold, event paramters will be estimated.

15.Label:
When the program goes to output the 'serialized' file,
  it will use the string that is in this line's location.
  Note: Changing the name will create a new file separate from the orig. name
