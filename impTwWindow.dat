1.
Location of input files, including jpl30s, and PRN_GPS_GPSDM file

2.
It uses the ACF files to know the correct standard deviation for the clocks.
Note: doesn't use the autocorrelation function, just the s.d.
If these files do not exist, the program will still work, but will assume
the "worst case" standard deviation.

2a.
The ACF files have a 'label' attached, because there are different ways of
calculating the ACFs and standard deviations.

5.
Will not run for any days that have fewer than this number of available clocks.
~7 seems reasonable.

6.
Fraction of clocks that need to experience a "vertical jump" (all jump at same
time) i.e. the reference-clock jump.
Should essentially always be 60% = 0.6.

7.
Of the clocks that experienced the 'vertical' jump, what fraction of these
also need to experience a jump in the opposite direction (in given window)
to be considered a "candidate event"

8.
Step size (in jump height, ns) for stepping over possible jump heigths.
Must be less than smallest possible sigma!

9.
Window of S^(1) jump heights (magnitudes) to consider

10.
Maximum J_W window size.

11.
Will only count jumps that occur within this range!
i.e. h +/- sigma
1.645sig = 90% c.l.

13.
Can search through all clocks, blocks, or just a given combination.
For example may be "Rb IIF" to only consider RbIIF clocks.
