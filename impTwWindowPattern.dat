1.
Location of input files, including jpl30s, and PRN_GPS_GPSDM file

2.
It uses the ACF files to know the correct standard deviation for the clocks.
Note: doesn't use the autocorrelation function, just the s.d.
If these files do not exist, the program will still work, but will assume
the "worst case" standard deviation.

2a.
The ACF files have a 'label' attached, because there are different ways of
calculating the ACFs and standard deviations.

3.
Folder for output.
On linux, will create this folder. Otherwise, you have to create it first!

6.
Will not run for any days that have fewer than this number of available clocks.
~7 seems reasonable.

7.
Fraction of clocks that need to experience a "vertical jump" (all jump at same
time) i.e. the reference-clock jump.
Should essentially always be 60% = 0.6.

8.
Of the clocks that experienced the 'vertical' jump, what fraction of these
also need to experience a jump in the opposite direction (in given window)
to be considered a "candidate event"

9.
Step size (jump height, ns) for stepping over possible jump heigths.
Must be less than smallest possible sigma!

11.
Will only count jumps that occur within this range!
i.e. h +/- sigma
1.645sig = 90% c.l.





**********
GPS weeks:
1060 => ~May 2000. First week that 30s solutions available
1147 => beginning of 2002
1303 => beginning of 2005
1280 => First available week that has ECI data. 
1881 => Last available week that has ECI data. 
0 is a wildcard - will go from 1060, to "end of 2018"
