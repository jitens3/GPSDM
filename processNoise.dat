====================
This file contains input parameters, read by "processNoise.x" program.

1:
Location for all 30_s clk, and PRN_GPS files.

2:
Location for output files. If this folder does
not exist, it will be created (only in LINUX!).
You can use this to make new directories for different runs, to seperate the 
files. Note that sometimes there can be many output files created, so if you no
longer need them, they should be deleted to save space.
NB: don't forget the trailing '/' !

3:
GPS weeks to include.
Placing "0" means all available weeks will be included.
If both values are the same, only that week will be run.
If the 'maxweek' is zero, will run only for the single week (minweek)

4:
Which days to include. 0 means only monday etc. 7 means do entire week.
Should really always be 7, except when testing and only doing a single day.

5:
Which functions to calculate? (Note: s.d. is always calculated!)
Each entry is just yes(1) or no(0).
SDunc = uncertainty in the standard deviation
PSD = power spectrums
ACF = Autocorrelation functions
AVAR = Allan variance
Hist = histogram
CrossClock Cor = Cross-Clock correlations

6. Exclude any clocks?
1) Exclude based on (1 order) s.d. 0=no, >0 means exclude clocks with sd's 
    larger than the given number. Typically 0 or >0.25
2) Exclude based on missed points? 0 means no, 1 means exclude if there
    is even 1 'missed' point, 2=exlucde if there are 2 missed points etc.
3) Outlier. If 0, won't skip. Otherwise, any clock that has an S1 data point
    larger than this number will be skipped. Should be >>~1 (or 0)

6a.
Remove a polynomial?
First option is polynomial order: 0=no polynomial subtract.
Second option is weighted (1/0 = yes/no)

7.
Swap the references?
0= no, just use the original (Hmaser) reference.
1= yes. Use every available GPS block as reference. Note: when swapping 
reference, clock is chosen by SVN (to ensure always the same clock for 0,1,2
order differecing).

8:
This is just a text label that will go in the output file name.
Helps you work out which settings were used to create that output run.
put 'na' for no label.

9:
For testing the simulated data.
1=use simulated data, 0=use real data.
Note: uses line (1) as input for the PSD files!
Second input is label of PSD files.
Uses randomised SVNs, and randomised reference clocks (USN3, AMC2, USN7)
Note: number of each clock simulated is hard-coded in!
Note: if there are no available clocks for a given reference, Hmas (i.e. the 
average reference clock) will be used instead without warning.
For example, for block II clocks and USN7 reference! - not big problem.
